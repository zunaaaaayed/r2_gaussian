# Repository map and retention policy

The entry point for current work is [NEXT_WEEK.md](../NEXT_WEEK.md).

| Location | Role | Retention |
|---|---|---|
| `experiments/independent_volume_evaluation/` | Current frozen TV results, candidate cohort and DICOM intake | Active |
| `experiments/ordinary_tv_controls/` | Paired-control runner, tests and original selection protocol | Completed controls; reusable guarded tooling |
| `experiments/limited_angle_generalization/` | Source-bound manifests, generation, verification, baseline workflow | Preserve paths and hashes |
| `experiments/limited_angle_120/` | Completed historical pilot and diagnostics | Preserve as evidence |
| `experiments/baseline_chest_50views/` | Initial baseline environment and reproduction records | Preserve as evidence |
| `Reports/` | Previous report and Week 3 source, plots, PDFs and Overleaf bundle | Published deliverables; preserve |
| `train.py`, `initialize_pcd.py`, `r2_gaussian/` | Inherited reconstruction implementation and native dependencies | Frozen baseline; preserve attribution/licenses |
| `data_generator/`, `scripts/`, `test.py`, `environment.yml` | Inherited input/analysis tooling and setup | Still referenced and potentially needed; not assumed obsolete |
| `README_UPSTREAM.md`, `assets/` | Original usage documentation and linked illustrations | Attribution/reference material |
| `TRDP2_CODEX_HANDOFF.md` | Historical first-session requirements | Historical specification; current status is in NEXT_WEEK |
| `data/`, `output/`, `logs/` | Local raw inputs, experiment products and operational logs | Ignored by Git; valuable research artifacts |
| `graphify-out/` | Local navigation graph | Regenerable index, not source of truth |

Old manifests and dated handoffs are historical snapshots, not duplicate current
instructions. Do not edit their dates/statuses to make them appear current. In
particular, keep the ordinary-TV selection protocol and its recorded hashes.

Python bytecode and LaTeX auxiliary files can be regenerated and are safe cleanup
targets when untracked. Compiled CUDA libraries, raw images, checkpoints, successful
or failed experiment logs, and backup archives are not disposable caches.

Before deleting or moving a tracked file, check frozen manifests and report links.
The source inventory includes tracked Python, CUDA/C++, headers, YAML and submodule
identities. Cosmetic reorganization of those files can invalidate reproducibility.
No blanket `git clean -xfd` should be used on this research checkout: it would
remove the ignored datasets and completed results.
